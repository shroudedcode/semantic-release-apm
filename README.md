# @semantic-release/apm

This was an attempt to create a set of [`apm`](https://github.com/atom/apm) plugins for [`semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release). It was abandoned because @pvdlg and I decided it would better to make a sharable config for it. Check it out [here](https://github.com/semantic-release/apm-config).
